## Our goals with this project were to...

- Discover whether risky behavior such as "substance abuse" and "weight issues" may appear more or less frequently among different categorical variables such as sex, race, etc. 

- Model how risky behavior trends throughout different grades

- Map important or interesting trends that we found along the way


# Our Dataset: Substance Abuse

```{r Substance_Abuse_Edited Glimpse}
glimpse(Substance_Abuse_Edited)

```

# Our Dataset: Weight Issues

```{r Weight_Issues_Glimpse}
glimpse(Weight_Issues_Edited)

```
# Substance Abuse over Time

```{r echo=FALSE}
SAE2 <- Substance_Abuse_Edited %>%
  filter(
    Sex != "Total",
    Greater_Risk_Question == "Drank alcohol for the first time before age 11 years"
  ) %>%
  drop_na(Greater_Risk_Data_Value) %>%
  group_by(Sex, YEAR) %>%
  summarise(Percentage_Greater_Risk = weighted.mean(Greater_Risk_Data_Value, Sample_Size)) 

SAE2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = Percentage_Greater_Risk, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal()

```


# Substance Abuse over Time

- Females at lower risk overall than men to abuse substances

- Risk of substance abuse has been going down over time
  - Although there was a slight resurgence in the latest year collected
  


# Using reveal.js

It's possible to have a horizontal sliding transition as well as nest multiple slides to create a vertical stack.

When presenting, you use the left/right arrows to step through the top-level (horizontal) slides. When you arrive at a vertical stack you can optionally press the up/down arrows to view the vertical slides or skip past them by pressing the right arrow.

(click the down key now)

## reveal.js

- The presentation is created using the `reveal.js` package

- You can create a slide show broken up into sections by using the # and ## heading tags

- You can also create a new slide without a header using a horizontal rule (----)

----

- You can also add pauses between content on a slide using (". . .")

. . .

Like this.

...or using "::: fragment"

::: fragment

Like this.

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

<div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">or text in two columns</div>
  <div style="float: left; width: 50%;">like this</div>
</div>

because you can combine HTML and Markdown syntax.

<p style="font-size: 8pt; position: absolute; bottom: -5em; width: 100%; text-align: center;">*You can also add footnotes</p>

# Summarise Important Data

Start off by summarizing the important variables needed for both data sets Weight and Substance Abuse. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}

```

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
:::: column
* Some text
* goes here
::::

:::: column
```{r warning=FALSE,  echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
```
::::
:::

## Different widths

::: columns
:::: {.column width="40%"}
* Some text
* goes here
::::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
```
::::
:::

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
```

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535448033526-c0e85c9e6968?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs (\$...\$), e.g. $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
