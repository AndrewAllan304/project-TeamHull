## 1. Introduction

The data we are going to be using is "Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS): Middle School". This data has a wide range of variables and entries from 1991-2017 that monitored young peoples behaviors (violence; tobacco use; substance abuse; sexual health; dietary health; and physical health). this one specifically focuses on substance abuse levels over a 26 year period within middle school.

This data was collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC). As of 25/10/2021, this data was last updated on March 29th, 2019. 

The 35 variables in this data set are year, loactionabbr, LocationDesc, DataSource, Topic, Subtopic, ShortQuestionText, Greater_Risk_Question, Description, Data_Value_Symbol, Data_Value_Type, Greater_Risk_Data_Value, Greater_Risk_Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol, Greater_Risk_Data_Value_Footnote, Greater_Risk_Low_Confidence_Limit, Lesser_Risk_Question,
Lesser_Risk_Data_Value, Lesser_Risk_Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol, Lesser_Risk_Data_Value_Footnote, Lesser_Risk_Low_Confidence_Limit, Lesser_Risk_High_Confidence_Limit, Sample_Size, Sex, Race, Grade, GeoLocation, TopicId, SubTopicID, QuestionCode, LocationId, StratID1, StratID2, StratID3 and StratificationType.
